**R4.** It is recommended that each package **free all system resources it has acquired** as soon as
they are no longer needed. This recommendation includes closing open files, freeing memory, freeing
MPI communicators, and freeing MPI data types created by the package. In particular, it is crucial that
xSDK compatible code not have any growing memory leaks (such as leaking memory during every
timestep). Any resources created by the package that should be freed by the user, rather than by the
package, must be fully documented. Valgrind can be used to locate when these resources are
mistakenly not released.
