Determine other package libraries and include directories.

    1. `--with-<package> --with-<package>-lib="linkable list of libraries” --with-<package>-include=”list of include directories”`
    2. `TPL_ENABLE_<package>=[YES,NO]`

Packages must provide a way for a user to specify a dependent package to use. Packages are free to locate a package on the file system if none is specifically provided by the user. If the user does provide one, however, it must be used; if it is not able to be used, then an error must be generated. A package cannot silently substitute a different installation.
