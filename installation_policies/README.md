# xSDK Community Installation Policies

Version 0.5.0, June 27, 2019

[https://xsdk.info/policies](https://xsdk.info/policies)

## Background

[What is software configuration?][1] and [How to configure software][2].

## Motivation

Combinations of multiple software packages developed by different groups have become essential for large-scale computational
science, where the capabilities needed for modeling, simulation, and analysis are broader than any single team has resources
to address. The often-tedious trial-and-error process of obtaining, configuring, and installing any single tool may arguably
be manageable.  From the perspective of an end-user application scientist, however, handling each tool’s installation 
idiosyncrasies can easily become overwhelming when dealing with several packages in combination. Worse, such problems are 
compounded by the need for consistency among packages to be used within the same application in terms of compiler, compiler 
version, exotic compiler optimization options, and common third-party packages such as BLAS and HDF5.

## Goal

A key aspect of work in the [IDEAS software productivity project][3] is developing an 
Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit ([xSDK](http://xsdk.info)). As an initial step in this work, our goal is 
to define and implement a standard subset^1^ of configure and CMake^2^ options for xSDK and 
other HPC packages in order to make the configuration  and installation process as efficient as possible on standard Linux
distributions and Mac OS, as well as on target machines at DOE computing facilities (ALCF, NERSC, OLCF). Note that we are
not requiring that all packages use the same installation software, merely that they follow the same standard procedure
with the same option names for installation. This approach provides maximum flexibility for each package to select the
most suitable toolchain to use for its package.

## Impact

Development of a standard xSDK package installation interface is a foundational step toward the seamless combined use of 
multiple xSDK libraries. The impact of this work is that all xSDK packages will have standard configuration and build 
instructions, as well as a tester to ensure that all functionality works properly. In addition, because new packages in the 
xSDK will follow the same standard, it is possible to make the installations "scriptable," that is, to write tools to install 
many packages automatically.  This work is part of the [xSDK Community Package Policies][4].

## xSDK Standard Configure and CMake Options^3^ 

**I1.** [Implement the xSDK defaults option.](/installation_policies/I1.md)

**I2.** [Identify location to install package.](/installation_policies/I2.md)

**I3.** [Select compilers and compiler flags.](/installation_policies/I3.md)

**I4.** [Create libraries with debugging information and possible additional error checking.](/installation_policies/I4.md)

**I5.** [Select option used for indicating whether to build shared libraries.](/installation_policies/I5.md)

**I6.** [Build interface for a particular additional language.](/installation_policies/I6.md)

**I7.** [Determine precision for packages that build only for one precision. Packages that handle all precisions automatically are free to ignore this option.](/installation_policies/I7.md)

**I8.** [Determine index size for packages that build only for one index size. Packages that handle all precisions automatically are free to ignore this option.](/installation_policies/I8.md)

**I9.** [Set location of BLAS and LAPACK libraries.](/installation_policies/I9.md)

**I10.** [Determine other package libraries and include directories.](/installation_policies/I10.md)

**I11.** [In the XSDK mode, XSDK projects should not rely on users providing any library path information in environmental variables.](/installation_policies/I11.md)

**I12.** [Provide commands for compiling, installing, and "smoke" testing.](/installation_policies/I12.md)

**I13.** [Package should provide a machine-readable output to show provenance.](/installation_policies/I13.md)

[//]: # "Main body footnotes"

^1^ Packages are free to support their own additional options, but using the standard options should be all that
is needed to get correct builds.

^2^ A subset of these standard behaviors is implemented in the XSDKDefaults.cmake module and is demonstrated and tested in the CMake project https://github.com/bartlettroscoe/XSDKCMakeProj.

^3^ This standard is related only to arguments to CMake and GNU Autoconf; there is no requirement regarding the make 
system used (for example, that it be GNU make) nor that the make system accepts any particular arguments, such as `make 
LIBS+=-lz`.
