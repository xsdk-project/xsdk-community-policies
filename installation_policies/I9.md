# I9 

Set location of BLAS and LAPACK libraries (default is to locate one on the 
system automatically). 

    1. `--with-blas-lib="linkable list of libraries” 
--with-lapack-lib=”linkable list of libraries”` -- it is fine to use
    -L and -l flags in the lists

    2. `TPL_BLAS_LIBRARIES="linkable list of libraries”`, 
`TPL_LAPACK_LIBRARIES=”linkable list of libraries”` -- should not use
    -L or -l flags in the lists
