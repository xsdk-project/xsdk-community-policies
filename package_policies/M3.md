# M3

Each xSDK-compatible package that utilizes MPI must restrict its MPI operations 
to MPI
communicators that are provided to it and not use directly MPI_COMM_WORLD. The 
package should
use configure tests or version tests to detect MPI 3 features that may not be 
available; it
should not be assumed that a full MPI 3 implementation is available. The 
package can
change the MPI error-handling mode by default but should have an option to 
prevent it from changing
the MPI error handling (which may have been set by another package or the 
application). The
package should also behave appropriately regardless of the MPI error handling 
being used. There is
no requirement that the package provide a sequential (non-MPI) version, 
although this functionality is
welcome, too. If the package provides a sequential version, there is no 
requirement that it be
compatible or usable with other xSDK-compatible packages running without MPI.
