Each xSDK-compatible package must support either the **community GNU Autoconf 
or CMake
options**^3^ as defined in the following document:

[xSDK Community Installation Policies: GNU Autoconf and CMake 
Options](./community-installation-policies.md).

The goal of this policy is to enable individual users, computing centers, and 
package managers (such
as [Spack](https://spack.io/)) to install the package in a way that is 
compatible with
other xSDK packages on the same system. It is understood that managing all the 
dependencies for a variety
of packages is nontrivial and is not resolved by standard options.

-----

^3^ Note that the package is free to use any mechanism, for example Python as 
PETSc does, to implement
the options but to users they should appear as if a CMake or GNU Autoconf 
configure package.
