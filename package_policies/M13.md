## Mandatory Policy M13

**M13.** When configured with a prefix, a package must install its headers and libraries under
`<install-prefix>/include/` and `<install-prefix>/lib/`, respectively. In addition, the library and header file names
should not have the version number embedded (except for shared libraries that can have
soname versions and symlinks like `lib<package>.so -> lib<package>.so.X -> lib<package>.so.X.Y.Z`).
