**M6.** Each package should **respect the decisions made by other previously called packages**
regarding system resources and settings. For example, each package may provide an API for
changing the floating-point exception (FPE) and signal handlers, and even set them in a particular
way by default, but there must be a way to prevent the change. Because it is impossible to determine
the current state of the FPE and signal handlers and thus restore them to the current state after
changing them, it is recommended that the xSDK packages adopt a common protocol for pushing and
popping FPE and signal handlers.
