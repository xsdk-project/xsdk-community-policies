# R3

It is recommended that each package **adopt and document a consistent system for
propagating/returning error conditions/exceptions** and provide an API for changing the behavior.
For example, all routines may, by default, return an error code with the option of changing it to
generate an abort on the error (for running in the debugger). No package should have hardwired calls
to abort, exit, or MPI_Abort(). Also, no package should have hardwired print statements for error
conditions. Each package should document which error codes/exceptions are recoverable, which may
result in lost resources (for example, unfreed memory), and which indicate that the process may be in
an undefined or totally broken state (for example, after a segmentation violation). It is the
responsibility of the calling routine not to simply continue the computation when a “hard” error is
returned; the calling routine will likely, by default, call an abort, but again that should be possible to
override.
