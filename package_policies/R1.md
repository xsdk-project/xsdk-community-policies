## Recommended Policy R1

**R1.** It is recommended that each package have a **public repository**, for example at GitHub or
Bitbucket, where the development version of the package is available. Support for taking **pull
requests** is also recommended since this will ease greatly the effort for users to provide
improvements to the packages.
