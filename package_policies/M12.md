**M12.** If a package imports software that is externally developed and maintained,<sup>8</sup> then it must allow
installing, building, and linking to an outside copy of that software. Acceptable ways to
accomplish this include (1) forsaking the internal copied version and using an externally provided
implementation or (2) changing the file names and namespaces of all global symbols to allow the
internal copy and the external copy to coexist in the same downstream libraries and programs.

------

<sup>8</sup> For example, some projects import source for some routines from BLAS and LAPACK. The Trilinos Teuchos
package imported an early version of the boost::any class. Also, Trilinos has its own copy of an older version of
SuiteSparse. In the latter two cases, new file names and namespaces were created for the imported software to
allow coexistence with the (updated) external versions.
